## Getting Started

To embark on your quest in the world of "Heros of Aetheria," follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SchoolyB/untitled-text-game.git

   ```

2. **Compile and run the Program:**

I have included a `build.sh` script to make compiling the program easier. To compile and run the program, run the following command:

```bash
./build.sh
```

This will create an executable file called `Aetheria.o`. You can run the executable if you do not need to compile again by running the following command:

```bash
./Aethoria.sh
```
