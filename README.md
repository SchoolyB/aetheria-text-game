## Getting Started

To embark on your quest in the world of "Heros of Aetheria," follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SchoolyB/aetheria-text-game.git
```
2. **Navigate to the Directory:**

```bash
cd your/path/untitled-text-game
```

3. **Compile and run the Program:**

I have included a shell script to make compiling and running the program easier. To <i><b><u>COMPILE AND RUN</u></b></i> the program at once, run the following command:

```bash
./execute.sh
```

This will create an executable file called `Aetheria.o`. You can run the executable if you <i><b><u>DO NOT</u></b></i> need/want to compile again by running the following command:

```bash
./Aethoria.exe
```

To compile the program <i><b><u>WITHOUT</u></b></i>  running it, run the following command:

```bash
./compile.sh
```
