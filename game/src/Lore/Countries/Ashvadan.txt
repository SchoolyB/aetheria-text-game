Ashvadan, ruled by the charismatic Prince Alessio Al-Ashvadi, is a coastal city-state along the azure shores of the Azure Gulf. Its stunning architecture includes grand temples and ornate palaces rising along the bustling waterfront. While Prince Alessio holds absolute authority, influential merchant families advise him, and social stratification is evident in the city. Beneath the opulent fa√ßade of luxury and riches lies a shadowy world of thieves' guilds, thriving in the city's labyrinthine alleyways and hidden passages.
