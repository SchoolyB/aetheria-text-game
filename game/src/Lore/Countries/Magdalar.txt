Magdalar, a vast and untamed territory, combines the fierceness of the Mongols with the warrior spirit of the Vikings. It is a land where numerous tribes perpetually vie for supremacy, each striving to claim the title of "Bloodraven," the most feared and dominant warrior-leader. The current ruler, Chief Bjorn Bloodraven of the Krythok tribe, holds this prestigious title, known for their strategic brilliance and martial prowess.

In Magdalar, people are born warriors, raised in a culture that venerates strength and valor. The tribes constantly engage in intricate political maneuvers, forming ever-shifting alliances and rivalries. These dynamics often lead to epic battles and campaigns, shaping the fate of the land.
