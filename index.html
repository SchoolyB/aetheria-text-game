        I am currently taking a break from large framework projects to work on a small and fun text based game written entirely in
        my favorite programming language "C". I am doing this to help me learn the language. This was initially prompted by me receiving
        my C Programming Language book by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie in the mail! No on to the game. Currently the game is untitled but it will allow users to create their own hero and launch into a fantasy world or magic and adventure. I have many ideas that I want to bring to life but Im sure it will take a long time. Im treating this project as a marathon not a sprint. For all I know I can be working on this years from now just for fun.
