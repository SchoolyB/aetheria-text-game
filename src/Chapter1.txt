Chapter 1: Awaken.

You open your eyes and yet you see nothing but darkness
You start to scream for help...But no noise comes out of your mouth
You have been charmed by a spell
You start to struggle and you feel that you hands are bound by some type of rope
You hands may be bound but your legs are free
You start to kick your legs and you feel that you are on a bed
So you start to roll off the bed making a loud thud as you land on old wooden floor
You come to your feet and begin walking around the room looking for a wall to cling to
You find a wall and you start to follow it around the room
As you follow the wall you scrape your hand on something incredibly sharp
you feel a warm liquid running down your hand
You're bleeding ever so slightly
You try to cut your binds with the sharp object to fee yourself
While you shimmy the sharp object between your binds you begin to hear voices coming closer and louder
It sounds like someone is walking up the stairs
You begin to panic and you start to cut faster
The voices become louder and more clear
'I Think they are awake.' The brutish voice say
'If they are I'll knock them out again while we wait to Thag.' The other voice says
You feel the binds start to loosen and you begin to cut even faster
The voices grow ever so closer
You feel the binds loosen and you pull your hands free
You hear the door open and see the bright light from a torch
'They're trying to escape stop them!' The brutish voice yells
Its now or never do you run or do you fight"
