Wesward, a vast and enigmatic land on the other side of the globe, is not a traditional nation but a collective of city-states, sects, villages, cults, and tribes that coexist in a delicate balance. It is renowned as the birthplace of magic, and the very air seems to shimmer with mystical energy. The land is shrouded in a veil of mystery, where ancient secrets and arcane knowledge are guarded with great zeal.

Wesward's diversity is its strength, as each city-state and sect possesses unique magical traditions and practices. The tribes are deeply attuned to the natural world, forging bonds with elemental spirits and creatures of the wilderness. Cults revere enigmatic deities and tap into the darker, forbidden aspects of magic. Villages hold ancient rituals and rites that connect them to the land itself.
